## ML Pipeline Implementation
**14 points** | *Corresponds to LMS: Experiential Learning Component*

*Criteria Description: Preprocessing pipeline, vocabulary construction, encoding, padding, and end-to-end pipeline integration (Activities 1–3).*

| Level | Points | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **5. Target** | 14 | Provides a comprehensive and fully functional preprocessing pipeline; all components integrate correctly end-to-end. |
| **4. Acceptable** | 11.9 | Provides a functional pipeline with all major components present; minor implementation details missing. |
| **3. Approaching** | 10.5 | Implements the pipeline with most components working; minor inaccuracies or incomplete integration present. |
| **2. Insufficient** | 9.1 | Implements some pipeline components but with significant gaps or functional errors. |
| **1. Unsatisfactory** | 0 | Does not implement a preprocessing pipeline, or implementation is non-functional. |

## Translation Analysis and Cross-Lingual Evaluation
**14 points** | *Corresponds to LMS: Sophisticated Feature Identification*

*Criteria Description: Round-trip translation experiment (10+ examples), model-based sentiment comparison, error classification (grammatical, semantic, contextual), and linguistic feature analysis.*

| Level | Points | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **5. Target** | 14 | Provides comprehensive examination of translation effects on model predictions with insightful classification and discussion of linguistic features. |
| **4. Acceptable** | 11.9 | Examines and classifies translation errors clearly using the model; minor details or examples missing. |
| **3. Approaching** | 10.5 | Examines translation effects and classifies errors; minor inaccuracies or insufficient number of examples present. |
